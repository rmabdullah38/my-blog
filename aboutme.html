            <h2>ABOUT RONNY</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ronny, and I am a sophomore at Stanford University, 
                majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. My academic excellence 
                in high school earned me recognition in the top 1% of my class and as an AP 
                Scholar with Distinction, averaging 5 on 12 AP tests. I've received several 
                scholarships, including the Questbridge National College Match, Jack Kent 
                Cooke College Scholarship, and Burger King, and was a semifinalist for the 
                Elks National MVS Scholarship. With 4+ years of tutoring experience, I've 
                helped students from elementary to high school levels with math, including 
                AP Calculus and standardized tests such as ACT and SAT
                <br><br>
                As a seasoned essay writer and tutor, I'm here to support you in your college 
                admissions journey. I'll help you enhance your essays, making them unique 
                and appealing to colleges. I'll guide you every step of the way, from 
                brainstorming to finalizing your college activities. I have a deep 
                understanding of the essay-writing process, and I'll teach you strategies to 
                stand out to admissions officers. My past students have been accepted into 
                prestigious schools, and I'm confident I can do the same for you.
                <br><br>
                In addition to essay writing, I also have experience with standardized test 
                preparation (ACT and SAT). I've helped several students significantly improve 
                their scores, and I'll share my techniques and tips to help you ace these 
                tests.
                <br><br>
                Tutoring math is a passion of mine as I find joy in helping others succeed in 
                a subject that can be challenging. My one-on-one approach allows for 
                personalized teaching, leading to deeper understanding and better results. 
                I'm dedicated to helping you achieve your goals, so let's get started!
