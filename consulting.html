            <p>I like to first get an understanding of where the student is in their comprehension of the concept or idea they're struggling with and then work with what they already know to explain the concept better, and then evaluate them to see if their understanding improved or if we should take a different approach.</p></div>

                    <p>Ronny is a great tutor. He helped with my daughter's calculus homework. He explained the concepts to her and guide her through the process of solving complex questions. I'd recommend Ronny for other parents.<br><br>

                    <p>I had a bit of trouble understanding some concepts in Calculus, but Ronny was able to patiently guide me throughout various question types! I highly recommend Ronny if you are looking for a tutor who is patient and willing to walk you through the problems step by step.<br><br>

                    <p>Ronny bad been an amazing help to my son and has re-energized his love for math! He was able to quickly understand his current abilities (and pain points) and calmly walk him through various solution options to help him navigate the lessons. Behind that he connected with my son on a personal level and I found them laughing about Harry Potter which Ronny had somehow connected to the lesson plan! Even more, my son is now asking me if I know certain techniques (I donâ€™t) that he feels PROUD to know about his work. Math is less stressful and homework time is a blast for my son since Ronny entered the picture. Oh and his last assessment had him with a 98%, over 12% points over his average over the last year. Thank you!<br><br>

                    <p>Ronny makes an effort to create a genuine connection with each student. That's truly what makes him special. As a Stanford student, his ability to draw from his own successful learning experiences (i.e. connecting his passion for books and basketball to math) is invaluable. More importantly, he is a positive influence on my student. Drawing upon his experiences as a teacher to his younger siblings, he is cool, engaging, calm; and funny. I could really see his care and patience when teaching shine through. He was always available for a phone call if we had any questions, and we appreciate his openness to working with our shifting schedules. Our only regret is that we wish we found Ronny sooner. My student's experience with Ronny has been wonderful, and my family gives our highest recommendation.<br><br>
